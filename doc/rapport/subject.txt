We consider a system of autonomous robots moving on a discrete space. Each
robot is pre-programmed with the same algorithm and the objective for the
robots is to collectively perform a task without the help of any central
controller. Designing algorithms for coordi- nation among the robots, without
any central authority is a challenging task. Some problems for mobile robots
that have been studied before are : gathering of robots in the same location,
filling a space with robots (e.g. [Barrameda et. al. 2008]), or the pattern
formation problem (e.g. [Gordon et al. 2003]).  In this project we will create
a program to visualize a distributed algorithm for mobile robots. Familiarity
with Java GUI programming is required for this project. Some knowledge of
distributed algorithms would be helpful for implementing this project.
